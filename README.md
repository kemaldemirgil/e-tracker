## About:
This application was created to organize and plan businesses, it allows the user to easily store data about their employee's, departments and roles. This application is an example of a `CRUD` operation, while applying additional features on top of it.\
Since this application was mainly created to practice `MySQL` by creating a simple **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem, it is only functional on `Node.js` therefore, it doesn't have a front end.

## Notes:
*E-tracker* is my first `MySQL` application, it also uses `inquirer.js` to run it however, at first it was really challenging trying to structure the foundation of it. At first, I tried creating separate files for each of the function to implement the ideal `OOP` structure but, I had too many errors and I didn't want to spend too much time on the aesthetics, so I wrote the whole program in a single file.\
Even though the code is a bit too much and repetitive, it does the job and that is what I'll be focusing for this project. In the future, I have better ideas to create a program like this in a much neater approach.

## Usage:
E-tracker allows the user to;
- `View all employees`
- `View all departments`
- `View all roles`
- `View all employees by manager`
- `View the total utilized budget of a department`
- `Add employee`
- `Add department`
- `Add role`
- `Update employee role`
- `Update employee manager`
- `Delete employee`
- `Delete department`
- `Delete role`

## Improvements:
Unfortunately, this isn't the perfect *bug free* application, it has some issues with it but can be solved with some more extra time spent on it. Besides that, for future improvement, a lot more options can be added for example; grouping multiple employees and doing `CRUD` operations on them, creating a schedule for each employee, adding a *first day* date for each employee, adding an address input for each employee and much more!

> Please contact me for any contributions or any input about this application, I would love to get some feedback and improve this simple project.
